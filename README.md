# 0verau
ncurses music player similar to cmus

```bash
make -j8  # 8 cores/threads to use in parallel compile
sudo/doas make install
```

# Start 0verau

To start the program you must supply 2 arguments, `0verau mp3/forlder ''` the second argument is for parsing \*.m3u files for playing online stream such as https://www.internet-radio.com/stations/house/ , download the \*.m3u file and supply it as argument so you should use it like this `0verau mp3/folder online_radio_stream.m3u` , to start playing the online stream you should press `SHIFT + ^` and it will start immediately.

# Requirements

In Debian it's `sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libsfml-dev libtag1-dev libmpg123-dev curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libvlc-dev libvlc-bin vlc`, in your other OS's search for `lib ncurses lib sfml lib tag lib mpg123 lib curl lib vlc vlc`.

# keybinds

You can specify your own keybings (before starting **0verau**) in `$HOME/0verau.conf` file:

```bash
# Default keybindings
UP=i
DOWN=j
PLAY=o
PAUSE=p
QUIT=q
REPEAT=@
SHUFFLE=!
SEARCH=/
VOLUMEUP=+
VOLUMEDOWN=-
SEEKLEFT=,

### Note



To search for specific song, quickly **press** `/` and type a couple charaters of the requested music file. Note that **NOT** to type the charaters that control (keybindings) the music player.

When you search for a song name and find it, make sure to erase the input with your backspace (above than Enter key), after that press the **search** key once again to bring you to the menu with the song files.
